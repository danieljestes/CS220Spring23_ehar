# Homework 1 (20 points)

Due Thursday January 26 by 5PM. Remember you can turn it in late with a 10% per day late penalty.

In this assignment you will write a few different C functions and call them from your `main` function. Create a directory
named `hw1` in your personal course repo. Note the spelling. Make sure the directory is named `hw1` and not `HW1` or
`Hw1`, etc. Also, a general rule of thumb as a programmer; never, ever, put spaces in a file name or directory, on any
operating system. Make sure all of the files outlined below are in your `hw1` directory and in your course repo by the
due date and time.

1. [5 points] Write a C function `sum3or5` that takes an integer parameter `n` and returns the sum of the integers
less than `n` that are multiples of 3 or 5. For example if `n` was 10 then the function would return 23 because 3 +
5 + 6 + 9 = 23. Put your code in a file named `sum3or5.c` and make sure it compiles separately using the
command `gcc -c sum3or5.c`. Make sure to test your code on several values of n. When n is 16 the
answer should be 60. When n is 1000 the answer should be 233168.
