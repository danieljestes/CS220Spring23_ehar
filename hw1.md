# Homework 1 (20 points)

Due Thursday January 26 by 5PM. Remember you can turn it in late with a 10% per day late penalty.

In this assignment you will write a few different C functions and call them from your `main` function. Create a directory
named `hw1` in your personal course repo. Note the spelling. Make sure the directory is named `hw1` and not `HW1` or
`Hw1`, etc. Also, a general rule of thumb as a programmer; never, ever, put spaces in a file name or directory, on any
operating system. Make sure all of the files outlined below are in your `hw1` directory and in your course repo by the
due date and time.

1. [5 points] Write a C function `sum3or5` that takes an integer parameter `n` and returns the sum of the integers
    less than `n` that are multiples of 3 or 5. For example if `n` was 10 then the function would return 23 because 3 +
    5 + 6 + 9 = 23. Put your code in a file named `sum3or5.c` and make sure it compiles separately using the
    command `gcc -c sum3or5.c`. Make sure to test your code on several values of `n`. When `n` is 16 the
    answer should be 60. When `n` is 1000 the answer should be 233168. 

    > extern int sum3or5(int n);

2. This problem should go in a file named `sequence.c` and should be separately compilable using the
    command `gcc -c sequence.c`
    
    1. [5 points] Consider the integer sequence defined as follows. Starting with any positive integer:
       If n is even, the next number in the sequence is n / 2. If n is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3n + 1
       It is conjectured (thought it is not known) that every such sequence eventually reaches 1. For example, if we
       started with 10 then the sequence is 10 5 16 8 4 2 1.
       Write a function named `sequence` that takes an integer `n` and returns the length of the sequence generated.
       In the above example this would be 7.
       
       > extern int sequence(int n);
        
    2. [5 points] Write a function named `longest` that returns the n â‰¤ 1000000 (one million) that generates the longest
       sequence. This function takes no parameters.
       
       > extern int longest();
 
3. [5 points] Write a function named `diamond` that that prompts the user for and reads a non-negative odd
   integer `n` from the user and prints a diamond pattern of `n` lines made up of asterisks. The function should be in
   a file named `diamond.c`. The middle row of asterisks should have `n` asterisks. The function should continue
   to prompt the user until they enter a -1. Here is a sample run of the function.
   
   > extern void diamond(int n);

```
Enter non-negative odd integer: 5

Enter a non-negative odd integer: 7

Enter a non-negative odd integer: -1
Bye!
```

4. Include a function named `main` in a file named `main.c` that calls each of the functions above.
