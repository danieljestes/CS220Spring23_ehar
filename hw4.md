## Digit Frequency (5 points)
Write a program that counts the number of times a digit occurs 
in an integer. For example, given the integer 224498344 the program might
output a table:

```
Digit    Frequency
-----    ---------
0        0
1        0 
2        2
3        1
4        4
5        0
6        0
7        0
8        1
9        1
```

Write a function `digit_freq` (in both C and assembly) that takes an integer
an array of integers.  When the function is complete the $i_{th}$ entry in 
array should be the frequency of digit `i`.
